# Download the bloater.exe file if you just want to run the executable file

A python script that generates a custom number of useless files with a custom number of characters used to needlessly take up a computer's memory

Displays how much memory is currently on the computer, how much memory will be bloated, and how much memory is left afterwards

WARNING: Running the program with large numbers (over 1000000 characters, over 10000 files) can crash a computer. It also goes without saying that creating enough files to take up all a computer's memory will cause massive slow downs and possibly long-term damage.

DISCLAIMER: Only use for educational purposes. I'm not responsible for any malicious uses you may find for this program.
